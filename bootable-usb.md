# create a bootable USB

- use a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to write the ISO directly to your drive; or
- use [Ventoy](https://www.makeuseof.com/ventoy-create-multiboot-usb/) to create a multi-boot USB. This way, you can keep multiple ISOs on one USB drive and boot whichever you need. All you need to do is install Ventoy on your USB drive once, then copy the DSL ISO file to it like any regular file.
